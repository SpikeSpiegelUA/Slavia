# Slavia
Unity ARPG

Open the Assets->Scripts folder to view code. All code was written by me. All asset creators are credited in the in-game credits.

Main Features:
-3 different classes with different playstyles, skills, dialogues and quests.
-Stealth system, simple combat system with an attack, power attack and block, simple archery and magic(with summoning!) systems, quest system with markers and dialogues with sometimes complex branches.
-Inventory system with cells(50 cells total). No item weight.
-Was integrated with the Google Play ServiceS, but then removed by me, so GPS is no longer working.
-Small open world without loading screens.
-Simple AI, that will attack hostile factions and the player.
-Save/Load system(of course).

Some screenshots(I will add more in the future):
