# Slavia
Unity ARPG

Open the Assets->Scripts folder to view code. All code was written by me. All asset creators are credited in the in-game credits.

Main Features:__
-3 different classes with different playstyles, skills, dialogues and quests.__
-Stealth system, simple combat system with an attack, power attack and block, simple archery and magic(with summoning!) systems, quest system with markers and dialogues with sometimes complex branches.__
-Inventory system with cells(50 cells total). No item weight.__
-Was integrated with the Google Play ServiceS, but then removed by me, so GPS is no longer working.__
-Small open world without loading screens.__
-Simple AI, that will attack hostile factions and the player.__
-Save/Load system(of course).__

Some screenshots(I will add more in the future):
