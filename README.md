# Slavia
Unity ARPG

Open the Assets->Scripts folder to see the codebase. The entire codebase was written by me. All asset creators are credited in the in-game credits.

Main Features:<br />
-3 different classes with different playstyles, skills, dialogues and quests.<br />
-Stealth system, simple combat system with an attack, power attack and block, simple archery and magic(with summoning!) systems, quest system with markers and dialogues with sometimes complex branches.<br />
-Inventory system with cells(50 cells total). No item weight.<br />
-Was integrated with the Google Play Services, but then removed from Google Play Store by me, so GPS is no longer working.<br />
-Small open world without loading screens.<br />
-Simple AI, that will attack hostile factions and the player.<br />
-Save/Load system(of course).<br />

Some screenshots from the Play Store page:

Some screenshots of a gameplay taken by me(I am running it on PC, while it's been developed for Android, also it's been 4 years since I developed it, so there may be some mistakes in UI or gameplay).
